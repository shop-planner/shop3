# Assumptions:
# 1.  Executed from shop/jenkins/ directory.
# 2.  There is a directory, on jenkins, the workspace, that contains a
# checked out copy of shop (checked out as "shop-trunk/" and has a
# copy of asdf in it.
# 3.  The environment variable LISP specifies the name of the lisp
# implementation to test.  See start-lisp.sh to see how to specify an
# executable path for the lisp implementations, if you don't have them
# in your path.
# 4.  If you want this to work /outside/ Jenkins, bind the WORKSPACE
# environment variable to a directory configured per (2), above.

# ASDF must be installed in the jenkins workspace.
