* The following entirely OBE
We have replaced NST with FiveAM for unit tests, so most of the following are
out of date.  The files in this directory are all overdue to be pruned.

* Running NST's jenkins script
To run a local version of NST's jenkins script, mimic the
=cadillac-jm.sh= and =beast-jm.sh= scripts.
 - Always define environment variables =NST_DIR= and =CLOSER_MOP_DIR=
   to where you have NST and Closer-to-MOP (respectively) stored.
 - The script looks for environment variables which indicate either:
   - The absolute path of Lisp platforms' executables.
   - That a particular platform should not be tested.
 - The variables which give pathnames to executables are:
   - NST_ALLEGRO_MIXEDCASE, for Allegro Common Lisp in "modern"
     mixed-case mode.
   - NST_ALLEGRO_UPCASE, for Allegro Common Lisp in classic
     case-insensitive, upper-case mode.
   - NST_ALLEGRO_MIXEDCASE8, for Allegro Common Lisp in "modern"
     mixed-case mode, limited to 8-bit characters.
   - NST_ALLEGRO_UPCASE8, for Allegro Common Lisp in classic
     case-insensitive, upper-case mode, limited to 8-bit characters.
   - NST_SBCL_UPCASE, for Steel Bank Common Lisp.
   - NST_CLISP_UPCASE, for GNU Clisp in classic case-insensitive,
     upper-case mode.
   - NST_CLISP_MIXEDCASE, for GNU Clisp in "modern" mixed-case mode,
     limited to 8-bit characters.
   - NST_CCL_UPCASE, for Clozure Common Lisp
 - The variables which indicate that a platform should be skipped are
   the above with SKIP_ prefixed.
 - End the wrapper script with a call to =./jenkins.perl=.
