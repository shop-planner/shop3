 ITEM may be any of the following:

    - one of the keywords :METHODS, :AXIOMS, :OPERATORS, :TASKS,
      :GOALS, :EFFECTS, or :PROTECTIONS, in which case SHOP will
      trace all items of that type (:GOALS, :EFFECTS, and :PROTECTIONS
      refer to three different ways predicates can occur: as goals to
      be satisfied, and as effects or protections in operators);
    - a pair of the form (:TASK <taskname>), (:METHOD <methodname>).  SHOP will
      break when attempting to expand the task, or apply the method, respectively.
    - the keyword :STATES, in which case SHOP will include the current
      state whenever it prints out a tracing message
    - the keyword :ALL in which case SHOP will print out all the tracing
      information it knows how to.
