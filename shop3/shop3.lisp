  "FIND-PLANS looks for solutions to the planning PROBLEM.
   PROBLEM should be a problem-designator (a PROBLEM or a symbol naming one).
   The keyword arguments are as follows:

     :WHICH tells what kind of search to do.  Its possible values are:

        :FIRST      - depth-first search, returning the first plan found.
        :ALL        - depth-first search for *all* plans.
        :SHALLOWEST - depth-first search for the shallowest plan in the
                      search space (this usually is also the shortest plan).
                      If there's more than one such plan, return the first.
        :ALL-SHALLOWEST - depth-first search for all shallowest plans.
        :ID-FIRST   - iterative deepening search, returning the first plan.
        :ID-ALL     - iterative deepening search for all shallowest plans.
        :RANDOM     - Randomized search.  Used by Monroe. Not for normal
                      SHOP3 domains, since normal SHOP3 domains have order-
                      dependent semantics.

     :VERBOSE says how much information to print about the plans SHOP3
              finds.  Its values can be any of the following:
        0 or NIL    - print nothing
        1 or :STATS - print some statistics on SHOP3's operation
        2 or :PLANS - print the stats and print all plans found, but omit
             operator costs and omit all operators whose names start with \"!!\"
        3 or :LONG-PLANS - print the stats and plans, including all operator
             costs and all operators (even those whose names start with \"!!\")
     :GC says whether to do a garbage collection before calling SEEK-PLANS
     :PLAN-TREE indicates whether or not to return plan tree(s).
     :COLLECT-STATE indicates whether or not to return final state(s).  For backward-
             compatibility, states are also returned whenever :PLAN-TREE is true.
             This should probably eventually change.
  RETURN VALUES:
     PLANS FOUND --- a list of plans.  Each plan is a list that alternates a
                     between instantiated operators and costs
     RUN TIME --- floating point value in seconds
       /if/ the PLAN-TREE keyword argument is supplied, there will be two
       additional return values:
     PLAN-TREES --- a list of plan trees, whose form is specified elsewhere.
     FINAL-STATES --- a list of final state structures, one per plan."
